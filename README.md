# flood-missing
Tracking the dead and missing from the 2015 Central Texs floods. Data is stored in Google Fusion Tables and accessed with the v1 API using [FusionTables.js](https://github.com/achavez/FusionTables.js/) and a Heroku proxy. Presentation is handled by a simple Marionette app.

### Mobile & social considerations
- the graphic is built using our Bootstrap template, which is responsive
- the grid and all photos resize to fit on mobile
- the page includes built-in buttons for social sharing
